        Heya! I'm Brendan, a Junior Front End Web Developer during the day, and
        a fun, goofy nerd 24/7! When I'm not developing web experiences, I like
        to share my thoughts on various topics such as video games, movies,
        anime, manga, music, and so much more! I write here to share my thoughts
        and passions on these topics with the world!
